# Chalkboard Battleship
This webpage is a fully functional Battleship game that you can play against an AI opponent. All assets aside from the font that are used in the webpage were created specifically for this project by me.

The font used is called Chalktastic and can be found here: (https://www.fontspace.com/chalktastic-font-f32933)

This webpage was developed entirely using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with Webpack packaging the webpage for efficient deployment.
